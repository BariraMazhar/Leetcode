The problem requires an algorithm to iterate through each character in the input string 's', utilizing a dictionary 'roman' to map each Roman numeral to its integer value.During iteration, it checks if the current numeral is less than the next numeral. If true, it subtracts the current numeral's value from the result 'res', as per the Roman numeral convention. Otherwise, it adds the numeral's value to res. This approach ensures correct conversion by considering subtraction rules in Roman numerals.
